# Overview

This is super super simple experiment that creates a chatbox using Dropbox. Just share the folder you cloned it in and run the chat.rb script.

# Requirements

Ruby and any gems you might not already have on your system. If it complains about a missing gem, run this

    gem install [gem name]

# Running it

Put this somewhere in your Dropbox folder and share the folder with your friends.

After that simply run:

    ruby chat.rb

Enter your nickname and start typing :).

# Quiting it

Just press:

    ctrl + c

# Known issues

Dropbox will probably create some conflicting copies of the 'chat.txt'. Nothing to worry about, you can delete them if you want.
